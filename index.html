            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Drag and drop is one of the most fundamental interactions
                afforded by graphical user interfaces.  In one gesture, it
                allows users to pair the selection of an object with the
                execution of an action, often including a second object in the
                operation.  It's a simple yet powerful UI concept used to
                support copying, list reordering, deletion (ala the Trash / Recycle Bin),
                and even the creation of link relationships.
            </p><p>
                Since it's so fundamental, offering drag and drop in web
                applications has been a no-brainer ever since browsers first
                offered mouse events in DHTML.  But, although
                <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, and
                <code>mouseup</code> made it possible, the implementation has been
                limited to the bounds of the browser window.  Additionally,
                since these events refer only to the object being dragged,
                there's a challenge to find the subject of the drop when
                the interaction is completed.
            </p><p>
                Of course, that doesn't prevent most modern JavaScript
                frameworks from abstracting away most of the problems and
                throwing in some flourishes while they're at it.  But, wouldn't
                it be nice if browsers offered first-class support for drag and
                drop, and maybe even extended it beyond the window sandbox?
            </p><p>
                As it turns out, this very wish is answered by the HTML 5 specification 
                <a target="_new" href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#dnd">section on new drag-and-drop events</a>, and 
                <a target="_new" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop">Firefox 3.5 includes an implementation</a> of those events.
            </p><p>
                If you want to jump straight to the code, I've put together 
                <a target="_new" target="_new" target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html">some simple demos</a> 
                of the new events.  
            </p><p>
                I've even scratched an itch of my own and
                built <a target="_new" target="_new" target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html">the beginnings of an outline editor</a>,
                where every draggable element is also a drop target—of which
                there could be dozens to hundreds in a complex document, something
                that gave me some minor hair-tearing moments at times in the past
                while trying to make do with plain old mouse events.
            </p><p>
                And, all the above can be downloaded or cloned from 
                <a href="http://github.com/lmorchard/fx35-drag-and-drop">a GitHub repository</a>
                I've created expecially for this article.

            <h2>The New Drag and Drop Events</h2>
            <p>
                So, with no further ado, here are the new drag and drop events,
                in roughly the order you might expect to see them fired:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt><code>dragstart</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    A drag has been initiated, with the dragged element as the
                    event target.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>drag</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    The mouse has moved, with the dragged element as the event target.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>dragenter</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    The dragged element has been moved into a drop listener,
                    with the drop listener element as the event target.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>dragover</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    The dragged element has been moved over a drop listener,
                    with the drop listener element as the event target.  Since
                    the default behavior is to cancel drops, returning
                    <code>false</code> or calling <code>preventDefault()</code> in
                    the event handler indicates that a drop is allowed here.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>dragleave</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    The dragged element has been moved out of a drop listener,
                    with the drop listener element as the event target.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>drop</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    The dragged element has been successfully dropped on a drop
                    listener, with the drop listener element as the event
                    target.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>dragend</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    A drag has been ended, successfully or not, with the
                    dragged element as the event target.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                Like the mouse events of yore, listeners can be attached to
                elements using <code>addEventListener()</code> 
                directly or by way of your favorite JS library.  
            </p><p>
                Consider the following example using jQuery, 
                <a target="_new" target="_new" target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#newschool">also available as a live demo</a>:
            </p>
            <pre lang="javascript">
    &lt;div id="newschool"&gt;
        &lt;div class="dragme"&gt;Drag me!&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="drophere"&gt;Drop here!&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('#newschool .dragme')
                .attr('draggable', 'true')
                .bind('dragstart', function(ev) {
                    var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;
                    dt.setData("Text", "Dropped in zone!");
                    return true;
                })
                .bind('dragend', function(ev) {
                    return false;
                });
            $('#newschool .drophere')
                .bind('dragenter', function(ev) {
                    $(ev.target).addClass('dragover');
                    return false;
                })
                .bind('dragleave', function(ev) {
                    $(ev.target).removeClass('dragover');
                    return false;
                })
                .bind('dragover', function(ev) {
                    return false;
                })
                .bind('drop', function(ev) {
                    var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;
                    alert(dt.getData('Text'));
                    return false;
                });
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
            </pre>
            <p>
                Thanks to the new events and jQuery, this example is both short
                and simple—but it packs in a lot of functionality, as the rest
                of this article will explain.  
            </p><p>
                Before moving on, there are at least three things about the above
                code that are worth mentioning:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Drop targets are enabled by virtue of having
                        listeners for drop events.  But, 
                        <a target="_new" href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#drag-and-drop-processing-model">per the HTML 5 spec</a>,
                        draggable elements need an
                        attribute of <code>draggable="true"</code>, set either in
                        markup or in JavaScript.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, <code>$('#newschool&nbsp;.dragme').attr('draggable', 'true')</code>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The original DOM event (as opposed to jQuery's event
                        wrapper) offers a property called <code>dataTransfer</code>.
                        Beyond just manipulating elements, the new drag and drop
                        events accomodate the transmission of user-definable data
                        during the course of the interaction.  
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Since these are first-class events, you can apply 
                        <a target="_new" href="http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/">the technique of Event Delegation</a>.
                    </p><p>
                        What's that?  Well, imagine you have a list of 1000
                        list items—as part of a deeply-nested outline document,
                        for instance.  Rather than needing to attach listeners
                        or otherwise fiddle with all 1000 items, simply attach
                        a listener to the parent node (eg. the
                        <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element) and all events from
                        the children will propagate up to the single parent listener.
                        As a bonus, all new child elements added after page
                        load will enjoy the same benefits.

            <h2>Using dataTransfer</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned in the last section, the new drag and drop events
                let you send data along with a dragged element.  But, it's even
                better than that:  Your drop targets can receive data
                transferred by content objects dragged into the window from 
                other browser windows, and even <i>other applications</i>.
            </p><p>
                Since the example is a bit longer,  
                <a target="_new" target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#data_transfer">check out the live demo</a>
                and 
                <a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/js/drag-datatransfer.js">associated code</a>
                to get an idea of what's possible with <code>dataTransfer</code>.
            </p><p>
                In a nutshell, the stars of this show are the
                <code>setData()</code> and <code>getData()</code> methods of
                the <code>dataTransfer</code> property exposed by the Event object.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>setData()</code> method is typically called in the 
                <code>dragstart</code> listener, loading <code>dataTransfer</code>
                up with one or more strings of content with associated
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Recommended_Drag_Types#link">recommended content types</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For illustration, here's a quick snippet from the example code:
            </p>
            <pre lang="javascript">
    var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    
    dt.setData('text/plain', $('#logo').parent().text());
    dt.setData('text/html', $('#logo').parent().html());
    dt.setData('text/uri-list', $('#logo')[0].src);
            </pre>
            </p><p>
                On the other end, <code>getData()</code> allows you to query
                for content by type (eg. <code>text/html</code> followed by
                <code>text/plain</code>).  This, in turn, allows you to decide
                on acceptable content types at the time of the
                <code>drop</code> event or even during <code>dragover</code>
                to offer feedback for unacceptable types during the drag.
            </p><p>
                Here's another example from the receiving end of the example code:
            </p>
            <pre lang="javascript">
    var dt = ev.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    
    $('.content_url .content').text(dt.getData('text/uri-list'));
    $('.content_text .content').text(dt.getData('text/plain'));
    $('.content_html .content').html(dt.getData('text/html'));
            </pre>
            <p>
                Where <code>dataTransfer</code> really shines, though, is that
                it allows your drop targets to receive content from 
                sources outside your defined draggable elements and even from
                outside the browser altogether.  Firefox accepts such drags, 
                and attempts to populate <code>dataTransfer</code> with
                appropriate content types extracted from the external object.
            </p><p>
                Thus, you could select some text in a word processor window and
                drop it into one of your elements, and expect to find it as 
                <code>text/plain</code> content—assuming your word processor
                plays nicely, which most do.  
            </p><p>
                You can also select content in 
                another browser window, and expect to see <code>text/html</code>
                appear in your events.  Check out the 
                <a target="_new" href="http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/outline.html">outline editing demo</a>
                and see what happens when you try dragging various elements and
                selected content from other windows onto the items there.
